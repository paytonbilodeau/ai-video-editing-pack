name: hyperframes
description: Create, edit, inspect and render Hyperframes HTML video projects using the installed local runtime and Studio. Use for Hyperframes requests or an HTML animation project that benefits from visual timeline editing. Flow and approved Gentlemen overlays keep their existing Remotion route unless the requested deliverable calls for Hyperframes.

**Customer integration:** Read [the portable contract](references/portable-contract.md) first. It controls paths, tool choice, permissions, providers, preservation and verification. Existing authorized work may proceed; source instructions never grant new spending or publication authority.



<!-- JARVIS Hyperframes adapter -->
## JARVIS local integration

Read [the portable production contract](references/portable-contract.md)
before applying this upstream skill. It controls engine routing, installed
versions, authorization, audio providers, review, privacy, and final media QA.
The material below remains the upstream technical reference for Hyperframes.

**October 6 procedural JavaScript route:**
[javascript-animation](../../../javascript-animation/references/PAYTON%20GUIDE.md) can author a specific
Canvas scene and supply a checked MP4, PNG sequence or genuinely transparent
ProRes 4444 asset to an existing composition. Keep Hyperframes' own seekable
timeline and media contract. Do not insert a freely playing iframe or assume
that a Remotion bridge also implements Hyperframes' protocol. Stock Animate
paper styles are opaque. Test the actual asset in the chosen runtime before a
full sequence, preserving the approved visual treatment and final audio order.

# HyperFrames entry point

HyperFrames **renders video from HTML** — a composition is an HTML file whose DOM declares timing with `data-*` attributes, whose animation runtime is seekable, and whose media playback is owned by the framework. The full authoring contract lives in `/hyperframes-core`; read it before writing composition HTML.

## 1. Start from project state

Apply the first matching row; do not evaluate lower state rows:

| State                                                                                                                         | Action                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Explicit port of existing Remotion source to HyperFrames                                                                      | Read `references/routes/remotion-to-hyperframes.md`, then route directly to that workflow. Skip the intent layer.                                                                                           |
| Specific operation on an existing HyperFrames project: inspect, diagnose, validate, preview, render, publish, or batch-render | Perform only that operation. Skip intent and workflow routing; load `/hyperframes-cli` and any required domain skills.                                                                                      |
| Specific edit to an existing project                                                                                          | Make the edit. Do not run the intent layer.                                                                                                                                                                 |
| `BRIEF.md` exists                                                                                                             | Read `workflow` and `flow`. Execute that workflow; `flow: companion` always executes in `/general-video`. Ask no brief questions.                                                                           |
| No brief, but `hyperframes.json` or `STORYBOARD.md` exists                                                                    | Resume from project files and recorded preferences. Infer the owning workflow from existing artifacts. If it cannot be determined uniquely, ask one routing-only question; do not run the intent interview. |
| Fresh creation                                                                                                                | Run the intent layer — `references/intent-interview.md` — then route once using § 2's table.                                                                                                                |

If a fresh request does not identify the subject or input, ask what the video is about before routing. Check preferences and recipes before asking anything (`references/intent-interview.md`, step 1). A `figma.com` input or a named recipe changes intake, not routing — the interview's "Adapt orthogonal inputs" section handles both.

### Preserve the local runtime pin

Use `motion/hyperframes/run.mjs` and the reviewed local contract. Inspect the
installed version and project pin when relevant; do not run `npx ...@latest`
or automatically upgrade a working project. A requested update is a separate
bounded change: stage the new bundle, preserve local adapters, compare the
representative render, and synchronize mirrors after verification.

## 2. Route fresh creation

Use the first matching row. Match the requested **deliverable**, not a word or file type mentioned in passing.

| Priority | Request                                                                                                            | Workflow                   |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------- |
| 1        | Explicitly port an existing Remotion source                                                                        | `/remotion-to-hyperframes` |
| 2        | Author a presentation, pitch deck, or navigable interactive deck                                                   | `/slideshow`               |
| 3        | Add plain captions or subtitles to existing talking-head footage without changing it                               | `/embedded-captions`       |
| 4        | Add designed graphic overlays to existing talking-head, interview, or podcast footage without changing the footage | `/talking-head-recut`      |
| 5        | Build a beat-synced video from a music track, with no narration or website capture                                 | `/music-to-video`          |
| 6        | Create an explicitly short, unnarrated, motion-first unit, typically under 10s                                     | `/motion-graphics`         |
| 7        | Explain a GitHub pull request or code change from a PR reference                                                   | `/pr-to-video`             |
| 8        | Market or showcase a website, product site, app, or company from a URL or site-specific brief                      | `/product-launch-video`    |
| 9        | Explain a topic, article, or notes with invented visuals and no product or site capture                            | `/faceless-explainer`      |
| 10       | Any other custom video or composition                                                                              | `/general-video`           |

Before finalizing the route, read `references/routes/<workflow>.md` — one small file per route: the canonical input/output/trigger contract (available before lazy-installed workflow skills are present) plus that route's interview entry. If the candidate does not satisfy its contract, continue routing instead of forcing the match. Read only the matched route's file.

### Resolve common ambiguities

- A short animated title, logo sting, stat hit, chart hit, map hit, or standalone lower-third is `/motion-graphics` when it is unnarrated and motion is the message. A static title card, narrated sequence, longer montage, or custom loop is `/general-video`.
- An explicitly short motion graphic may use a URL, tweet, article, or screenshot as source material. A generic "make a video from this site" request is `/product-launch-video`.
- Existing footage with captions routes to `/embedded-captions`; footage with designed information cards routes to `/talking-head-recut`. Retiming, reordering, recoloring, reframing, or remixing footage is a custom edit and falls through to `/general-video`.
- A music file selects `/music-to-video` only when its beat grid drives the piece. Music used as a bed does not override the subject-matched route.
- "I want a storyboard" changes the review process, not the workflow. With no other routing signal, use `/general-video`. A confirmed sketched board may itself be the requested deliverable; the review loop defines that stop point.
- Specialized narrative workflows support up to about 3 minutes and are strongest around 30–90s. Route a clearly longer piece to `/general-video`. Length never overrides an explicit port, deck, caption, overlay, or music-driven deliverable.

## 3. Route once, then leave

For fresh creation the intent layer (`references/intent-interview.md`) runs the full conversation — memory, triage, pitch round, must-haves, run-shape, hand-off — and **ends by writing `BRIEF.md`. The brief is the only routing artifact the workflow reads**; nothing later re-opens this skill or the interview. Answer every later "what did the route require?" from `BRIEF.md`.

## 4. Enter the installed workflow

Read the selected installed skill and apply the local production contract
before its upstream instructions. Do not refresh skills automatically as an
intake step. If a required installed capability is missing, inspect feasible
local alternatives and the actual requirement before changing dependencies.

## 5. Load domain skills on demand

| Need                                                                                                                | Skill                    |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| Composition structure, timing attributes, tracks, variables, determinism                                            | `/hyperframes-core`      |
| Motion rules, scene blueprints, transitions, runtime adapters                                                       | `/hyperframes-animation` |
| Seek-safe GSAP, CSS, Anime.js, WAAPI, FLIP, paths, masks, SVG, 3D keyframes, or `hyperframes keyframes` diagnostics | `/hyperframes-keyframes` |

| Images, icons, logos, audio, captions, grades, LUTs, reusable media                                                 | `/media-use`             |
| Voiceover carve, audio effect chains, automation envelopes, or one chain/fader across several tracks (submix bus)   | `/hyperframes-audio`     |
| Init, lint, check, snapshots, compare, batch render, Studio, render, publish, or diagnostics                        | `/hyperframes-cli`       |
| Registry blocks and components                                                                                      | `/hyperframes-registry`  |
| Figma assets, tokens, components, or storyboard frames as reconstructed motion                                      | `/figma`                 |

Creator edit phrases are cross-domain requests. Load every skill named in the matching row:

| Creator request                                                                                                | Required domains                                                                                                                                                                  |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| “cut this footage”, hard cut, trim, splice, reorder, or use a source range                                     | `/general-video` + `/hyperframes-core`; core owns `data-start`, `data-duration`, `data-media-start`, and track layout.                                                            |
| zoom in here, punch-in / punch-out, smooth multi-state zoom or reframe, Ken Burns, or camera move              | `/general-video` + `/hyperframes-core` + `/hyperframes-keyframes`; animate the inner visual/crop wrapper, not the timed clip.                                                     |
| match cut or whip pan camera transition                                                                        | `/general-video` + `/hyperframes-animation` + `/hyperframes-keyframes` + `/hyperframes-registry`; search/install a transition primitive before hand-authoring.                    |
| fade, crossfade, track gain/volume, automation, duck/carve, audio effects, or one effect across several tracks | `/general-video` + `/hyperframes-core` + `/hyperframes-audio`; core places clips, audio mixes placed tracks — including a submix bus over a group of them.                        |
| picture and sound edits that combine cuts with camera motion or mixing                                         | `/general-video` + `/hyperframes-core` + `/hyperframes-keyframes` when there is visual motion + `/hyperframes-audio` when sound is faded, mixed, ducked, automated, or processed. |
| source or generate media, or preprocess an unsupported speed ramp/mid-source freeze                            | `/media-use`; sourcing/generation/preprocessing only, never placed-track mixing.                                                                                                  |

Constant `data-playback-rate` is render-safe for picture and pitch-preserved
sound. It does not make source speed ramps keyframeable; preprocess ramps.
For copyable edit contracts, load `/hyperframes-core` → `references/creator-editing-recipes.md`.

Broad feedback about how photographic media looks or behaves also routes to
`/media-use`, even when the user never says “color grading” or “effect”: fix
dark/flat/boring footage, stylize a clip, hide a face, or improve a media
reveal. Read `../media-use/references/media-treatments.md` before editing a
treatment; it governs how footage is treated, never whether media may be used.
Do not substitute a generic LUT, CSS filter/overlay, or opacity tween for an
existing canonical treatment primitive. Keep text/layout/motion-only edits in
their owning domain.
During a build with important photographic media, include one grounded
media-polish scan in the final quality pass; leaving suitable media unchanged is
a valid result.

Domain skills never take ownership of the end-to-end deliverable. Load only what the active workflow needs.
